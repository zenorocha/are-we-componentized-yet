			<h2 id="wtf">Web Components!?</h2>

			<p>What are web components? They are encapsulated, reusable and composable widgets for the web platform. If that sounds cool, then I urge you to check out one of the <a href="http://youtu.be/fqULJBBEVQE">very good introductions</a> to them that others have provided. In my opinion, they're the most exciting thing to happen in web development since HTML5. Why? Because they promise to put the power and extensibility necessary to build sophisticated widgets and applications right into core web feature set. Imagine the capabilities of libraries like Angular, Ember, and Backbone, but as a foundation of the platform, standardised across all browsers.

			<p>The purpose of this page is to track progress across the various documents where web components are being specified, the polyfills that let you use them today, and their implementation in browsers that will make them a first class citizen of the web in the months and years to come.</p>
			
			<p>For lots more information about Web Components, including discussions, developer docs, and best practices, check out <a href="http://webcomponents.github.io/">webcomponentsorg.github.io</a>. For available components made by the community, check out <a href="http://customelements.io/">customelements.io</a></p>

			<h2>Specs!</h2>

			<p>Web components are being specified at the W3C, with Dimtri Glazkov leading the charge, ably assisted by various other heroes. Spec documents have a reputation in some quarters as being dense and unreadable, which is perhaps partly deserved. They do contain a lot of details that only browser engineers really need to worry about. But, modern specs also often contain very readable explainers and examples, and they're usually the most accurate and detailed source of information on how things really work.</p>

			<ul class="specs">
				<li>
					<a href="http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/templates/">HTML Templates Editor's Draft</a> —
					<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-templates/">Working Draft</a>

				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="polyfills">Polyfills!</h2>

			<p>There are two polyfills of web components available. The first is <a href="http://www.x-tags.org/">X-Tags by Mozilla</a>, and the second is <a href="http://polymer-project.org">Polymer by Google</a>.

			<p>Both libraries share a core set of polyfills for the main features of web components, such as custom elements and templates, but each builds upon it in a slightly different way. To quote the <a href="http://www.x-tags.org/blog">official X-Tag blog</a>:</p>

			<blockquote>
				"X-Tag and Polymer are both high-level sugar libraries that build upon the W3 Web Components specs - each introduces a different approach to making development of web components an even more amazing experience. To help make this more relatable, consider the following: jQuery : DOM :: X-Tag/Polymer : Web Components."
			</blockquote>

			<p>Mozilla and Google are collaborating on building the shared polyfills that underpin the libraries. This should allow each organisation to explore different features and approaches, while retaining a core of compatibility. Now is the time for developers to experiment with both these libraries and provide feedback on what works and what doesn't, so it can be incorporated back into the specs and help to make web components even better!</p>

			<h2 id="code">Code!</h2>

			<p>Implementation of web components within browsers has begun, although the split of Blink from WebKit has muddied the waters slightly. This appears to be the status at present:</p>

			<ul class="browsers">
				<li class="chrome">
					<p>
						Chrome is the gold standard. Google has been leading to effort to spec and implement web components, and two of its features, shadow DOM and templates, are already shipping in Chrome's stable channel, while development is fast progressing on others.
					</p>
					<p>
						The shift from WebKit's bugzilla to the Chromium tracker has made it a little more difficult to follow the implementation effort, as there aren't the meta bugs and trees I used to use to follow everything, but most of the relevant issues are linked in the table above.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li class="firefox">
					<p>
						Mozilla haven't been slouching either, and have made good progress towards implementing various parts of web components in Firefox. They have <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=811542">a tracking bug here</a>, and various features are being implemented via its dependencies.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li class="safari">
					<p>
						Although a number of web components features were implemented by Google within the WebKit codebase, they were never switched on in Safari. With the departure of the Chromium port, the WebKit maintainers have begun to remove features <a href="https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2013-May/024894.html">such as shadow DOM</a> from the codebase. This is understandable from an engineering perspective, as unused code shouldn't be left lying around, but as a web developer it's disappointing to see.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li class="ie">
					<p>
						Microsoft don't talk about their development plans publicly, so it's not clear if and when they will implement web components features, but there are positive signs: They co-edit the HTML Templates spec, and they have history providing an analogous feature in IE's old element behaviours<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. The recently released IE11 doesn't seem to contain any of the web components APIs, but it does contain support for ancillary features such as Mutation Observers and Pointer Events that are useful for building components and polyfills. 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li class="opera">
					<p>
						As Opera have switched to base their browsers on Chromium/Blink, I expect they will broadly follow Chrome in terms of implementation status.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Who made this?</h2>

			<p>I'm Jon Rimmer, a web developer who spends way too much of his free time reading blogs, W3C mailing lists and teleconference minutes to find out what's happening with the web platform. I don't work for a browser vendor or standards group, but I've been a fan of the web components technology since I first heard of it, and this is my way of helping me and others keep track of its development. <a href="http://blog.brillskills.com">I have a blog</a>, where I ramble unceasingly.</p>

				<li id="fn1">It's a perfectly cromulent word.</li>
				<li id="fn2">While element behaviours were less fully featured than web components, it's tempting to wonder what would have happened if Mozilla and others had reverse engineered, specced and implemented them a decade ago, as happened with XHR.</li>
				<li id="fnDecorators">Decorators haven't progressed much beyond an interesting idea at this point. It <a href="https://twitter.com/dglazkov/status/350999681330982913">remains to be seen</a> whether they will eventually progress to standardisation and implementation.</li>
